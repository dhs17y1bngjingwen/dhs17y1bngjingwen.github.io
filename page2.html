<h2>What we did:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>We took a tour around the museum</li>
 <li>We learned about the different phylas and the class chordata</li>
 <li>We did were given specimens which belonged to different phylas and we had to figure out which phyla they belong to</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>My feelings:</h2>
<p>Out of all the other learning journeys, I enjoyed this one the most as our co-form teacher was with us and we also took a class photo. 
I love science and to be able to learn about different phylas and to learn about the class chordata is vry interesting to me and I enjoyed that a lot.
And in this learning journey, we were able to stay indoors and enjoy the air-condition while on other journeys, we had to head out. 
I hope to have more of such learning journies in the future.</p>
